        <h1>TPNHA Inventory Dashboard</h1>
        <p>We intend to have the TPNHA Collection's inventory finalized by Summer 2022. We estimate that there are approximately one thousand items in the collection, as recieved by Iona College. In the meantime, you can follow our progress in real time. We will only provide item specific details for item records that have completed our rigorous review process.</p>
        <p>As of <em>right now</em>, the ITPS Archival Research Database contains records for:</p>

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>With generous funding from the Gardiner Foundation, The ITPS has begun a multi-year project to create a Digital Archive from the physical TPNHA Collection. The Archival Research Database contains the foundational metadata for the future Digital Archive and provides Iona College students, faculty, and staff a way to create and enhance inventory records while also answering recombinatorial research queries.</p>
        <p>The ITPS is working closely with the Ryan Library, especially Natalka Sawchuck, Assistant Director of Libraries and ITPS Affliate Librarian, without whom this project would not exist. Additional cataloging in OCLC has been performed by Diana Kiel, Coordinator of Technical Services. </p>
